[Andrew Ng Introduction to Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?utm_source=Techarena51.com&utm_medium=sem&utm_content=Data-Science-wiki) 

Summary: Best Beginners course for Machine Learning

Excerpt from the Course:
This course on Coursera provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: (i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas. There is also an option for Certification from Standford

[R for DataScience Book](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/?utm_source=Techarena51.com&utm_medium=sem&utm_content=Data-Science-wiki)

Summary: Best book for Data Visualisation and EDA with R, GGplot2 and Tidyverse cran packages

Excerpt from the Book :
"This is the website for “R for Data Science”. This book will teach you how to do data science with R: You’ll learn how to get your data into R, get it into the most useful structure, transform it, visualise it and model it. In this book, you will find a practicum of skills for data science. Just as a chemist learns how to clean test tubes and stock a lab, you’ll learn how to clean data and draw plots—and many other things besides. These are the skills that allow data science to happen, and here you will find the best practices for doing each of these things with R. You’ll learn how to use the grammar of graphics, literate programming, and reproducible research to save time. You’ll also learn how to manage cognitive resources to facilitate discoveries when wrangling, visualising, and exploring data."
